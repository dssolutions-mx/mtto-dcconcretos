# Dialog Component Extraction

## Purpose

Dialog extraction is crucial for maintaining modularity in larger React applications. This rule provides guidelines for identifying when to extract dialogs into separate components and how to structure them properly.

## When to Extract Dialog Components

Extract a dialog component when:

1. The dialog contains complex forms or multiple input fields
2. The dialog is used in multiple places
3. The dialog's content is longer than 50-70 lines
4. The dialog has its own state management needs
5. The dialog handles complex user interactions

## How to Structure Dialog Components

### Folder Organization

```
components/
├── feature/                  
│   ├── dialogs/               # All dialogs related to this feature
│   │   ├── create-dialog.tsx  # Individual dialog components
│   │   └── edit-dialog.tsx    
│   └── feature-component.tsx  
```

### Dialog Component Pattern

```tsx
// Dialog component template
export function FeatureDialog({
  open,                      // Required
  onOpenChange,              // Required
  initialData,               // Optional, for edit dialogs
  onSubmit,                  // Optional, callback function
  // Other props as needed
}) {
  // Local state management
  const [localState, setLocalState] = useState(initialData || {});
  
  // Dialog content and handlers
  
  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <DialogContent>
        <DialogHeader>
          <DialogTitle>Title</DialogTitle>
          <DialogDescription>Description</DialogDescription>
        </DialogHeader>
        
        {/* Dialog content here */}
        
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => onOpenChange(false)}>
            Cancel
          </Button>
          <Button onClick={handleSubmit}>
            Submit
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

## State Management in Dialogs

1. **Local State**: Use `useState` for form fields and UI state
2. **Form State**: Consider `react-hook-form` for complex forms
3. **Parent State**: Use callbacks (`onSubmit`, `onCancel`) to communicate with parent

## Examples from Codebase

### Good Dialog Examples

- [components/assets/dialogs/photo-upload-dialog.tsx](mdc:components/assets/dialogs/photo-upload-dialog.tsx): Properly encapsulated dialog functionality
- The maintenance task dialog in the asset registration form

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each dialog should handle one specific task
2. **Controlled Component**: Always make dialogs controlled (open/onOpenChange props)
3. **Careful with Context**: Don't overuse context in dialogs
4. **Cache Form State**: For large forms, consider caching state between dialog opens
5. **Loading States**: Include loading states for async operations
6. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully within the dialog
7. **Accessibility**: Ensure dialogs are fully accessible (focus management, ARIA)

## Dialog Testing

- Test dialog open/close behavior
- Test form submission
- Test validation logic
- Test error states

## Dialog Size Guideline

A dialog component should ideally not exceed 200-250 lines of code. If it does:

1. Split into multiple dialogs if the dialog has multiple steps
2. Extract form sections into separate components
3. Move complex logic to custom hooks
4. Consider wizard pattern for multi-step processes
