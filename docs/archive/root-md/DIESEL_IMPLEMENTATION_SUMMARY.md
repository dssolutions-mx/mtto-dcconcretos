# 🛢️ Diesel Management System - Quick Summary

## ✅ What Was Built (Stages 1-4 Complete)

### **📱 3 Mobile Forms**
1. **Consumption Form** (`/diesel/consumo`)
   - Asset selection (formal + external equipment)
   - Warehouse selection (Business Unit → Plant → Warehouse)
   - Cuenta litros auto-fill + validation
   - Asset readings (hours/kilometers)
   - 1 photo required (machine display)
   - ✅ Auto-updates warehouse inventory

2. **Entry Form** (`/diesel/entrada`)
   - Supplier/provider tracking
   - Invoice number optional
   - Cost tracking (unit + total)
   - 3 optional photos (delivery, invoice, tank gauge)
   - ✅ At least 1 photo required
   - ✅ Auto-increases warehouse inventory

3. **Adjustment Form** (`/diesel/ajuste`)
   - Positive (+) or Negative (-) adjustments
   - Predefined reason dropdown
   - 2 optional photos (flexible)
   - Prevents negative inventory
   - ✅ Auto-adjusts warehouse inventory

### **📊 Dashboard** (`/diesel`)
- Total inventory summary
- Warehouse cards with:
  - Current inventory + capacity %
  - Color-coded progress bars
  - Cuenta litros display
  - Last update timestamp
- Recent transactions log (last 10)
- Quick action buttons

### **🏠 Main Dashboard Integration**
- Diesel card added (FIRST position)
- Quick access for high-priority ops
- Uses existing permission system

## 🗄️ Database Changes Applied

### **New Tables**
✅ `diesel_evidence` - Photo evidence tracking  
✅ `diesel_inventory_snapshots` - Reconciliation support  

### **Enhanced Tables**
✅ `diesel_transactions` - Added `previous_balance`, `current_balance`  
✅ `diesel_warehouses` - Added `current_inventory`, `current_cuenta_litros`, `has_cuenta_litros`, `last_updated`  

### **Triggers**
✅ `trigger_update_warehouse_on_transaction` - Auto-updates warehouse on INSERT  
✅ Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS  

### **Storage**
✅ `diesel-evidence` bucket with RLS policies

## 🎯 User Workflows Ready

✅ Register diesel consumption (with asset readings + cuenta litros)  
✅ Register diesel entry/delivery (with invoice tracking)  
✅ Register inventory adjustments (positive/negative)  
✅ View real-time inventory across warehouses  
✅ Track recent transactions  
✅ Business unit filtering (users see only their warehouses)

## 🔜 Future Work (Not Required for Launch)

- Stage 5: Offline capabilities (infrastructure ready, can follow checklist patterns)
- Transaction history page with advanced filters
- Monthly reconciliation workflows
- Consumption analytics per asset
- Automated snapshots
- PDF reports

## 📈 Lessons Applied from Fixes

1. ✅ Never hardcode database IDs - fetch dynamically
2. ✅ Use SECURITY DEFINER for system triggers
3. ✅ Store frequently accessed data (current_inventory)
4. ✅ Handle optional data gracefully (cuenta litros)
5. ✅ Support organizational hierarchy (BU → Plant → Warehouse)
6. ✅ Flexible asset support (formal + exception)
7. ✅ Auto-fill for better UX
8. ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

## 🎓 Key Technical Decisions

**Why SECURITY DEFINER on trigger?**  
Bypasses RLS so warehouse updates work automatically regardless of user permissions.

**Why store current_inventory in warehouse?**  
Faster queries, no calculations needed, always up-to-date via trigger.

**Why support "exception" assets?**  
Users need to track external/rented equipment not in formal asset registry.

**Why cuenta litros optional?**  
Plant 2 doesn't have cuenta litros system (confirmed by user).
