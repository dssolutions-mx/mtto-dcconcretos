# Multiple Quotations Support - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

Successfully implemented support for multiple quotation files in the Purchase Order system. Users can now upload multiple quotation files when creating purchase orders, instead of being limited to a single file.

---

## ‚úÖ Changes Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

**New Column Added:**
- `quotation_urls` (JSONB) - Stores array of quotation file URLs
- Indexed with GIN index for performance
- Legacy `quotation_url` column maintained for backwards compatibility

**New Database Function:**
```sql
has_quotations(p_purchase_order_id UUID) -> BOOLEAN
```
- Checks if a purchase order has quotations (supports both old and new format)
- Used by workflow validation to ensure required quotations are uploaded

**Migration Files:**
- `/migrations/sql/20250102_multiple_quotations_support.sql` - Complete migration
- Applied via Supabase MCP on 2025-01-02

---

### 2. TypeScript Type Updates

**File:** `types/purchase-orders.ts`

Updated interfaces:
```typescript
export interface EnhancedPurchaseOrder {
  // ... existing fields
  quotation_url?: string      // Legacy - maintained for backwards compatibility
  quotation_urls?: string[]   // New - array of quotation file URLs
  // ... other fields
}

export interface CreatePurchaseOrderRequest {
  // ... existing fields
  quotation_url?: string       // Legacy single URL
  quotation_urls?: string[]    // Array of quotation URLs (preferred)
  // ... other fields
}
```

---

### 3. Component Updates

#### **QuotationUploader Component**
**File:** `components/purchase-orders/creation/QuotationUploader.tsx`

**New Features:**
- ‚úÖ Support for multiple file uploads
- ‚úÖ Individual file management (remove specific files)
- ‚úÖ Progress indicator for multiple files
- ‚úÖ Display list of uploaded files with preview links
- ‚úÖ Backwards compatible with single file mode

**New Props:**
```typescript
interface QuotationUploaderProps {
  allowMultiple?: boolean           // Enable/disable multiple uploads (default: true)
  onFilesUploaded?: (urls: string[]) => void  // Callback with all URLs
  onFileUploaded?: (url: string) => void      // Legacy callback (maintained)
  // ... other props
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Multiple file selection via file input
- Individual file removal
- Automatic upload on file selection
- Visual feedback for each uploaded file
- Error handling per file
- Size limit: 10MB per file
- Supported formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, WebP

---

#### **SpecialOrderForm Component**
**File:** `components/purchase-orders/creation/SpecialOrderForm.tsx`

**Changes:**
- State updated to use `quotationUrls: string[]` instead of single URL
- Validation checks for at least one quotation file
- Form submission includes `quotation_urls` array
- QuotationUploader configured with `allowMultiple={true}`

**Updated Usage:**
```tsx
<QuotationUploader
  workOrderId={workOrderId}
  isRequired={true}
  allowMultiple={true}
  onFilesUploaded={(urls) => {
    setQuotationUrls(urls)
    setFormErrors(prev => prev.filter(error => !error.includes('cotizaci√≥n')))
  }}
  onFileRemoved={() => {
    setQuotationUrls([])
  }}
/>
```

---

#### **DirectServiceForm Component**
**File:** `components/purchase-orders/creation/DirectServiceForm.tsx`

**Changes:**
- State updated to use `quotationUrls: string[]`
- Validation updated for services > $10,000 MXN
- Form submission includes multiple quotations
- QuotationUploader configured with `allowMultiple={true}`

---

### 4. Backend Updates

#### **Purchase Order Service**
**File:** `lib/services/purchase-order-service.ts`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// When creating purchase order, convert array to JSON string for database
quotation_urls: request.quotation_urls ? JSON.stringify(request.quotation_urls) : null
```

---

#### **API Endpoint Updates**
**File:** `app/api/purchase-orders/[id]/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `quotation_urls` to editable fields
- Special handling to convert array to JSON string on update
- Maintained backwards compatibility with `quotation_url`

```typescript
const editableFields = [
  // ... other fields
  'quotation_url',
  'quotation_urls',  // New field
  // ... other fields
]

// Special handling for quotation_urls
if (field === 'quotation_urls' && Array.isArray(body[field])) {
  updateData[field] = JSON.stringify(body[field])
}
```

---

### 5. Storage Configuration

**Bucket:** `quotations` (private bucket)
- Uses Supabase Storage
- Files organized by work order ID or purchase order ID
- Signed URLs with 7-day expiry
- RLS policies enforce access control

**File Naming Convention:**
```
{workOrderId or purchaseOrderId}/{timestamp}_{sanitized_filename}.{ext}
```

---

## üéØ Business Logic

### Quotation Requirements by Purchase Order Type

1. **Direct Purchase (`direct_purchase`)**
   - ‚ùå Never requires quotation
   - Multiple files: Optional

2. **Direct Service (`direct_service`)**
   - ‚úÖ Requires quotation if amount > $10,000 MXN
   - Multiple files: Allowed when required

3. **Special Order (`special_order`)**
   - ‚úÖ Always requires quotation
   - Multiple files: **Required** (can upload multiple quotes from different suppliers)

---

## üìä User Experience Improvements

### Before (Single File)
- ‚ùå Could only upload one quotation file
- ‚ùå Had to delete and re-upload to change
- ‚ùå Couldn't compare multiple supplier quotes

### After (Multiple Files)
- ‚úÖ Upload multiple quotation files at once
- ‚úÖ Remove individual files without affecting others
- ‚úÖ Compare quotes from different suppliers side-by-side
- ‚úÖ Better documentation for special orders
- ‚úÖ Visual list of all uploaded quotations with preview links

---

## üîÑ Backwards Compatibility

The implementation maintains full backwards compatibility:

1. **Legacy single `quotation_url`:**
   - Still supported in database
   - Still accepted in API
   - Existing purchase orders remain functional

2. **Dual support in validation:**
   - `has_quotations()` function checks both formats
   - Workflow validation accepts either format

3. **Migration safety:**
   - No breaking changes to existing data
   - Existing purchase orders continue to work
   - New features are additive, not replacements

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:

- [ ] **Special Order Form**
  - [ ] Upload single quotation file
  - [ ] Upload multiple quotation files (2-3 files)
  - [ ] Remove individual files
  - [ ] Remove all files and verify validation error
  - [ ] Submit form with multiple quotations
  - [ ] Verify files are accessible in purchase order details

- [ ] **Direct Service Form**
  - [ ] Service < $10k: Verify quotation is optional
  - [ ] Service > $10k: Upload multiple quotations
  - [ ] Verify validation for services > $10k without quotations

- [ ] **File Operations**
  - [ ] Upload PDF files
  - [ ] Upload image files (JPG, PNG)
  - [ ] Verify file size limit (10MB)
  - [ ] Test file type validation
  - [ ] Verify signed URL access (7-day expiry)

- [ ] **Purchase Order Workflow**
  - [ ] Create PO with multiple quotations
  - [ ] Verify quotations appear in approval workflow
  - [ ] Approve/reject PO with multiple quotations
  - [ ] Verify quotations are preserved through workflow

- [ ] **Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Upload same file multiple times (should allow)
  - [ ] Remove and re-upload files
  - [ ] Very long filenames
  - [ ] Special characters in filenames (should be sanitized)
  - [ ] Upload while previous upload in progress
