   - Some part numbers and intervals may vary depending on specific machine configuration (cab/no-cab, aux hydraulics, A/C, etc.)
   - **Always verify parts and intervals in your official Operation & Maintenance Manual (OMM) for your specific serial number**

2. **Oil Analysis (S·O·S Program):**
   - Cat strongly recommends oil sampling every 500 hours to monitor fluid condition
   - Sampling ports are color-coded and accessible from ground level
   - Results inform decisions on extending or shortening fluid change intervals

3. **Severe Operating Conditions:**
   - If operating in dusty, wet, high-temperature, or high-load environments, reduce intervals by 25–50%
   - Example: In humid/tropical climates (like Ecuador), air filters and fuel filters may require replacement every 250–350 hours instead of 500 hours
   - Hydraulic oil sampling frequency may increase to every 250 hours

4. **Part Source:**
   - All Caterpillar part numbers are sourced through **parts.cat.com** or authorized Caterpillar dealers
   - Aftermarket equivalents may be available but verify compatibility with your specific serial and configuration

5. **Manual Reference:**
   - Official Caterpillar Operation & Maintenance Manual for 938G (4YS prefix): **SEBU series manuals**
   - Request specific manual from Caterpillar dealer using your machine serial number
   - Spanish-language manuals also available through regional dealers

6. **Qualified Technician Work:**
   - Engine valve lash adjustment (1000 hours): requires trained technician
   - Hydraulic cylinder seal replacement (2000 hours): requires trained technician
   - Transmission work: requires qualified transmission technician
   - Frame/weld inspection (4000+ hours): recommend certified inspection service
