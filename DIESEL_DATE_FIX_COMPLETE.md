# Diesel Date Fix - Complete Solution ✅

## 🎯 Problem Identified
The diesel import system was incorrectly parsing dates from the CSV files:
- **CSV Format**: `DD/MM/YY` (Latin American - Day/Month/Year)
- **Parser Was Reading**: `MM/DD/YY` (American - Month/Day/Year)
- **Example**: `08/02/25` should be **February 8, 2025**, but was imported as **August 2, 2025**

This resulted in ALL transaction dates being incorrect by several months.

---

## ✅ Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Date Parser Fixed
**File**: `lib/diesel-parser-utils.ts` (Lines 14-36)

```typescript
// Parse DD/MM/YY to Date (Latin American format)
export function parseSmartsheetDate(dateStr: string): Date | null {
  if (!dateStr || !dateStr.trim()) return null
  try {
    // Handle DD/MM/YY format (e.g., 08/02/25 = February 8, 2025)
    const parts = dateStr.trim().split('/')
    if (parts.length !== 3) return null
    
    const day = parseInt(parts[0], 10)      // ✅ First part is DAY
    const month = parseInt(parts[1], 10)    // ✅ Second part is MONTH
    let year = parseInt(parts[2], 10)
    
    // Convert 2-digit year to 4-digit
    if (year < 100) {
      year += year < 50 ? 2000 : 1900
    }
    
    const date = new Date(year, month - 1, day)
    return isNaN(date.getTime()) ? null : date
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}
```

### 2. All Previous Error Fixes Preserved
The following fixes remain in place and will work correctly on re-import:

#### ✅ Frontend (`components/diesel-inventory/tabs/ProcessingTab.tsx`)
- **Line 272**: Enriches ALL rows with asset mappings, including exceptions
- **Lines 292-306**: Enhanced debug logging for enrichment tracking

#### ✅ Backend (`app/api/diesel/process-batch/route.ts`)
- **Lines 28-50**: Debug logging for incoming data verification
- **Lines 250-258**: Asset mapping check includes exception assets
- **Lines 264-279**: Unassigned consumption handles exception assets
- **Lines 293-298**: Adjustment consumption handles exception assets
- **Lines 333-344**: Entry adjustments can store reference in `exception_asset_name`
- **Lines 390-398**: Skips zero-liter validation entries
- **Lines 410-415**: Rounds decimal meter readings to integers
- **Lines 382, 388**: Removed generated columns from INSERT
- **Lines 128-140, 443-455**: Asset lookup uses resolved UUIDs
- **Lines 149, 174, 460**: Date parsing handles JSON serialization

#### ✅ Database
- **Constraint Updated**: Allows exception consumptions
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE public.diesel_transactions
  ADD CONSTRAINT diesel_transactions_asset_id_check
  CHECK (
      (transaction_type = 'entry' AND asset_id IS NULL) OR
      (transaction_type = 'consumption' AND (asset_id IS NOT NULL OR asset_category = 'exception'))
  );
  ```
- **Warehouses Created**: ALM-001-6, ALM-002-7, ALM-003-8, ALM-004-9

### 3. Safety Scripts Created

#### **Cleanup Script**: `scripts/clean-diesel-for-reimport.sql`
- Safely deletes all diesel transactions
- Includes verification queries
- Preserves warehouses and other infrastructure

#### **Restore Script**: `scripts/restore-manual-diesel-entries.sql`
- Contains SQL to re-add manual entries if missing:
  - Opening inventories for Plants 1, 2, 4
  - Plant 1 adjustments (-1,201 L and -240 L)
  - Plant 4 missing entry (4,720.3 L)
- Includes verification queries for inventory validation

### 4. Documentation Created
- **`DIESEL_REIMPORT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: Step-by-step re-import guide
- **`DIESEL_DATE_FIX_AND_REIMPORT_PLAN.md`**: Detailed planning document
- **This file**: Complete solution summary

## 📊 Manual Entries to Preserve

These entries were manually added to correct inventory discrepancies. After re-import with correct dates, verify if they need to be re-added:

### Opening Inventories
| Plant | Amount | Date | Reason |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| P001 | 2,511 L | Jan 2, 2025 | Opening balance |
| P002 | 1,585 L | Jan 3, 2025 | Opening balance |
| P004 | 1,314.8 L | Jan 6, 2025 | Opening balance |

**Note**: The CSV for Plant 1 shows opening inventory on `08/02/25` = February 8, 2025 with 2,511 L. Need to verify if we need both the Jan 2 entry AND the Feb 8 entry, or if the Feb 8 entry (from CSV) is sufficient.

### Plant 1 Adjustments
| Date | Amount | Type | Reason |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Jun 12, 2025 | -1,201 L | Consumption | Inventory adjustment |
| Jul 15, 2025 | -240 L | Consumption | Inventory adjustment |

**Note**: These may not be in the CSV and will likely need to be re-added manually.

### Plant 4 Missing Entry
| Date | Amount | Type | Reason |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Feb 8, 2025 | 4,720.3 L | Entry | Fuel receipt missing from import |

**Note**: User confirmed this was missing from the CSV.

## 🔄 Re-import Process

### Step 1: Clean Database
```sql
DELETE FROM diesel_transactions;
```

### Step 2: Re-upload CSV Files
Upload all plant CSV files through the Diesel Migration interface:
- Plant 1 CSV
- Plant 2 CSV
- Plant 3 CSV
- Plant 4 CSV

**Asset mappings are preserved** - no need to re-map!

### Step 3: Verify Dates
Check that dates are correct (should show February as `2025-02-XX`, not `2025-08-XX`):
```sql
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  transaction_date,
  quantity_liters
FROM diesel_transactions
ORDER BY transaction_date
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 4: Check for Missing Entries
Run queries to verify opening inventories and adjustments are present. If missing, run the restore script.

### Step 5: Verify Final Inventory
```sql
SELECT 
  p.code,
  SUM(CASE WHEN dt.transaction_type = 'entry' THEN dt.quantity_liters ELSE -dt.quantity_liters END) as inventory
FROM diesel_transactions dt
JOIN plants p ON dt.plant_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.code;
```

**Expected**:
- Plant 1: 838 L
- Plant 2: 5,431.2 L
- Plant 4: 3,780.4 L
