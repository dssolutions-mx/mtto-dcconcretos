   - Performance indexes and RLS policies
   - Comprehensive data validation and constraints

2. **Type Definitions** (`types/suppliers.ts`)
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all entities
   - API request/response types
   - Component prop types

3. **Supplier Registry UI** (`components/suppliers/SupplierRegistry.tsx`)

   - Tabbed interface for different data views
   - Performance metrics visualization
   - Contact and service management

### API Endpoints Design
```typescript
// Core Supplier Management
GET    /api/suppliers              - List suppliers with filtering
POST   /api/suppliers              - Create new supplier
GET    /api/suppliers/[id]         - Get supplier details
PUT    /api/suppliers/[id]         - Update supplier
DELETE /api/suppliers/[id]         - Deactivate supplier

// Advanced Features
GET    /api/suppliers/suggestions  - Get supplier suggestions for work orders
GET    /api/suppliers/analytics    - Get supplier performance analytics
GET    /api/suppliers/search       - Advanced supplier search
POST   /api/suppliers/[id]/services - Add supplier services
```

### Suggestion Algorithm
**Multi-Factor Scoring System:**
- **Performance Score (40%)** - Historical ratings and reliability
- **Relevance Score (30%)** - Asset type and problem matching
- **Availability Score (20%)** - Response time and capacity
