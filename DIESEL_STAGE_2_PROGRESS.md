# Diesel Management System - Stage 2 Progress

## Mobile-First Components - Core Consumption Flow ✅

### ✅ Components Built

#### 1. **AssetSelectorMobile** (`components/diesel-inventory/asset-selector-mobile.tsx`)
**Mobile-first asset selection with intelligent filtering**

Features:
- ✅ **Business Unit Filtering**: Automatic filtering based on user's organizational level
  - Global users (GERENCIA_GENERAL): See all assets
  - Business unit users (JEFE_UNIDAD_NEGOCIO): See all plants in their BU
  - Plant users: See only their plant's assets
- ✅ **Smart Search**: Search by asset_id, name, model, manufacturer, plant
- ✅ **Recent Assets**: localStorage-based recent selections (top 5)
- ✅ **Rich Asset Info**: Shows model, plant, current hours/km readings
- ✅ **Touch-Optimized**: Large touch targets, clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ **Compact Selected View**: Shows selected asset with ability to change
- ✅ **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, desktop

**User Flow**:
1. Open selector → Shows filtered assets by business unit
2. Search or scroll → Recent assets appear first
3. Tap asset → Shows compact summary with all details
4. Tap X to change → Back to selection view

---

#### 2. **ReadingCapture** (`components/diesel-inventory/reading-capture.tsx`)
**Asset reading capture with validation (inspired by checklist system)**

Features:
- ✅ **Hours/Kilometers Support**: Based on asset's maintenance_unit
- ✅ **Real-time Validation**: 
  - Cannot decrease (except small resets < 100h or 1000km)
  - Cannot have unrealistic jumps (> 10,000h or 100,000km)
  - Visual indicators: green checkmark, red warning, orange alert
- ✅ **Increment Display**: Shows +XXX hours/km from current reading
- ✅ **Contextual Hints**: Shows current reading as reference
- ✅ **Meter Reset Detection**: Warns but allows if reading is less than current
- ✅ **Optional Readings**: Can skip if asset has no meters
- ✅ **Mobile-Optimized**: Large inputs, numeric keyboards, touch-friendly

**Validation Logic**:
- Green ✓: Reading > current, realistic increment
- Red ⚠️: Invalid (negative jump > threshold or unrealistic increase)
- Orange ⚠️: Warning (possible meter reset)
- Null: No validation needed or not enough data

---

#### 3. **ConsumptionEntryForm** (`components/diesel-inventory/consumption-entry-form.tsx`)
**Complete consumption recording with cuenta litros validation**

Features:
- ✅ **Step-by-Step Flow**:
  1. Select Asset (AssetSelectorMobile)
  2. Enter Quantity (liters consumed)
  3. Enter Cuenta Litros reading
  4. Capture Asset Readings (hours/km)
  5. Upload Evidence Photos (2 required)
  6. Add Notes (optional)

- ✅ **Cuenta Litros Validation** (CRITICAL):
  - Fetches previous cuenta litros reading for asset
  - Calculates movement: current - previous
  - Compares with quantity_liters
  - Tolerance: ±2L (measurement margin)
  - Visual feedback: Green check or Red warning
  - Auto-marks for validation if variance > 2L

- ✅ **Evidence Requirements** (ENFORCED):
  - Photo 1: Machine display showing liters dispensed (REQUIRED)
  - Photo 2: Cuenta litros meter reading (REQUIRED)
  - Uses existing SmartPhotoUpload (no nested camera)
  - Stores in diesel_evidence table with categories

- ✅ **Balance Tracking**:
  - Fetches current warehouse balance via RPC
  - Calculates: previous_balance → current_balance
  - Stores both in transaction for traceability
  - Warns if balance insufficient (< -50L safety margin)

- ✅ **Asset Reading Updates**:
  - Updates asset.current_hours if provided
  - Updates asset.current_kilometers if provided
  - Stores previous readings in transaction

- ✅ **Offline Indicators**:
  - Shows online/offline status badge
  - Ready for offline sync (prepared for Stage 5)

- ✅ **Success Feedback**:
  - Toast with quantity consumed and new balance
  - Warning toast if marked for validation
  - Clears form for next entry
  - Callback for navigation

**Validation Summary**:
```
Transaction marked for validation if:
- Cuenta litros variance > 2L
- Reading decreases significantly
- Balance goes negative (> 50L safety)
```

---

### ✅ Page Created

**Consumption Page** (`app/diesel/consumo/page.tsx`)
- Wraps ConsumptionEntryForm with dashboard layout
- Handles success/cancel navigation
- Suspense boundary for loading states
- Centered layout for mobile focus

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Interactions

**Consumption Entry Flow**:
1. Load user profile (plant_id, business_unit_id, role)
2. Load assets with hierarchical filtering
3. Load previous cuenta litros for selected asset
4. Calculate warehouse balance via `get_warehouse_current_balance()` RPC
5. Create diesel_transaction with balance tracking
6. Insert 2 diesel_evidence records (machine + cuenta_litros)
7. Update asset readings (if provided)

**SQL Queries Used**:
```sql
-- Get assets (with hierarchical filtering)
SELECT ... FROM assets WHERE plant_id IN (...)

-- Get previous cuenta litros
SELECT cuenta_litros FROM diesel_transactions 
WHERE asset_id = ? AND transaction_type = 'consumption' 
ORDER BY transaction_date DESC LIMIT 1

-- Get warehouse balance
SELECT get_warehouse_current_balance(warehouse_id)

-- Insert transaction
INSERT INTO diesel_transactions (...)

-- Insert evidence
INSERT INTO diesel_evidence (transaction_id, evidence_type, ...)
```

### State Management

**Form State**:
- selectedAsset: Full asset object with plant, model, readings
- quantityLiters: Decimal input (string for precision)
- cuentaLitros: Decimal input for meter reading
- previousCuentaLitros: Loaded from last transaction
- readings: {hours_reading, kilometers_reading}
- notes: Optional text
- machinePhoto: URL after upload
- cuentaLitrosPhoto: URL after upload

**Validation State**:
- cuentaLitrosValid: boolean | null (null = no validation yet)
- cuentaLitrosVariance: number | null (absolute difference)
- isOnline: boolean (network status)
- loading: boolean (submission state)

### Validation Logic Implementation

**Cuenta Litros**:
```typescript
const movement = currentCuenta - previousCuenta
const variance = Math.abs(movement - quantity)

if (variance <= 2) {
  valid = true  // Within tolerance
} else {
  valid = false // Requires manual validation
}
```

**Asset Readings**:
```typescript
if (reading < current - threshold) {
  invalid = true  // Too large decrease
} else if (reading < current) {
  warning = true  // Possible meter reset
} else if (reading - current > maxJump) {
  invalid = true  // Unrealistic increase
} else {
  valid = true
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### Happy Path (< 60 seconds)
1. Open /diesel/consumo
2. Search asset → Select from recent
3. Enter quantity: 150L
4. Enter cuenta litros: 1250
5. ✓ Auto-validates (variance 0.5L)
6. Enter hours: 5150 (current 5000)
7. Photo 1: Machine display
8. Photo 2: Cuenta litros meter
9. Tap "Registrar Consumo"
10. ✓ Success! New balance shown

**Time**: ~45 seconds for experienced operator

### Validation Required Path
1-4. Same as above
5. ⚠️ Shows variance 5L (cuenta litros says 145L movement)
6. Continue anyway
7-9. Same as above
10. ⚠️ Success with validation warning
11. Supervisor reviews later in validation queue

## Known Issues / TODO

1. **Warehouse/Plant Selection**: Currently hardcoded in page.tsx
   - Need to fetch from user profile or allow selection
   
2. **Product ID**: Hardcoded to default diesel product
   - Should fetch from diesel_products table
   
3. **Offline Sync**: Prepared but not implemented yet
   - Will be Stage 5
   
4. **Search Debouncing**: Search is immediate
   - Could add 300ms debounce for performance
   
5. **Image Preview**: Photos upload but no preview before submit
   - SmartPhotoUpload handles this, but could enhance
   
6. **Recent Assets**: Stored in localStorage
   - Could sync across devices via Supabase
   
7. **Validation Queue**: Transactions marked for validation
   - Need supervisor view to approve/reject (Stage 3)
