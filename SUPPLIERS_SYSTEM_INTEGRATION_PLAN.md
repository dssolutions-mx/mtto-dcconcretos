# Suppliers System Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines how the new Suppliers System will integrate with existing systems to enhance purchase orders, work orders, and supplier management efficiency.

## Core Integration Points

### 1. Purchase Orders Integration

#### Current State
- `purchase_orders` table has a `supplier` field (string)
- `service_provider` field for direct service orders
- No centralized supplier data or performance tracking

#### Integration Strategy
- **Replace string supplier field** with UUID reference to `suppliers` table
- **Migration strategy**: Create mapping table for existing supplier names
- **Enhanced supplier selection** in purchase order forms
- **Automatic supplier performance updates** when purchase orders are completed

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add `supplier_id` field to `purchase_orders` table
2. Create migration script to map existing supplier strings to new supplier records
3. Update purchase order forms to use supplier selection dropdown
4. Add supplier performance tracking triggers

### 2. Work Orders Integration

#### Current State
- Work orders can be assigned to users via `assigned_to` field
- No supplier assignment or suggestion system
- No historical supplier performance for specific asset types

#### Integration Strategy
- **Add supplier suggestions** based on asset type, problem type, and location
- **Track supplier work history** with specific assets
- **Enable supplier assignment** to work orders
- **Generate purchase orders** with suggested suppliers

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add `suggested_supplier_id` and `assigned_supplier_id` to `work_orders`
2. Create supplier suggestion algorithm based on:
   - Asset type/category
   - Problem description keywords
   - Geographic location
   - Past performance history
3. Update work order creation forms with supplier suggestions
4. Add supplier performance tracking to work order completion

### 3. Payment Integration

#### Current State
- Payment information stored in purchase orders
- No supplier-specific payment preferences or history
- Manual payment term management

#### Integration Strategy
- **Store supplier payment preferences** in supplier records
- **Track payment history** and reliability
- **Auto-populate payment terms** based on supplier preferences
- **Generate payment reminders** based on supplier payment terms

#### Implementation Steps
1. Update payment creation to use supplier payment preferences
2. Add payment history tracking to supplier performance
3. Create payment reminder system based on supplier payment terms
4. Add supplier payment reliability scoring

### 4. Asset Maintenance Integration

#### Current State
- Asset maintenance history exists but no supplier correlation
- No supplier specialization tracking per asset type
- No preventive supplier recommendations

#### Integration Strategy
- **Link maintenance work** to specific suppliers
- **Track supplier expertise** by asset type/category
- **Generate supplier recommendations** for recurring maintenance
- **Build supplier knowledge base** for asset-specific issues

#### Implementation Steps
1. Add supplier tracking to maintenance history records
2. Create supplier expertise scoring by asset type
3. Add supplier recommendation engine for maintenance tasks
4. Build supplier knowledge base with solution patterns

## API Integration Points

### New API Endpoints
```

POST   /api/suppliers              - Create new supplier
GET    /api/suppliers/[id]         - Get supplier details
PUT    /api/suppliers/[id]         - Update supplier
DELETE /api/suppliers/[id]         - Deactivate supplier

GET    /api/suppliers/[id]/performance    - Get supplier performance metrics
GET    /api/suppliers/[id]/work-history   - Get supplier work history
GET    /api/suppliers/[id]/services       - Get supplier services
POST   /api/suppliers/[id]/services       - Add supplier service

GET    /api/suppliers/suggestions          - Get supplier suggestions for work order
GET    /api/suppliers/search              - Search suppliers by various criteria
GET    /api/suppliers/analytics           - Get supplier analytics and metrics
```

### Modified Existing Endpoints
- `POST /api/purchase-orders` - Add supplier_id validation and performance tracking
- `PUT /api/work-orders/[id]` - Add supplier assignment capabilities
- `POST /api/maintenance/work-orders` - Include supplier suggestions

## User Interface Integration

### Enhanced Purchase Order Forms
- **Supplier Selection Dropdown** instead of free-text input
- **Supplier Details Preview** on selection
- **Supplier Performance Indicators** (rating, reliability)
- **Supplier Contact Information** auto-population
- **Payment Terms Auto-fill** based on supplier preferences

### Enhanced Work Order Forms
- **Supplier Suggestion Panel** with reasoning
- **Supplier Assignment Interface** with search and filter
- **Supplier Performance History** for selected supplier
- **Asset-Specific Supplier Recommendations**

### New Supplier Management Interface
- **Supplier Registry/Catalog** with search and filtering
- **Supplier Performance Dashboard** with metrics and trends
- **Supplier Contact Management** with multiple contacts per supplier
- **Supplier Service Catalog** management
- **Supplier Certification Tracking**

## Data Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Supplier Name Mapping
1. Extract all unique supplier names from existing purchase orders
2. Create basic supplier records with extracted names
3. Map existing purchase orders to new supplier records
4. Add supplier_id field to purchase_orders table

### Phase 2: Service Provider Mapping
1. Extract service providers from direct service orders
2. Create supplier records for service providers
3. Link service orders to supplier records
4. Migrate service_provider field to supplier_id

### Phase 3: Historical Performance Data
1. Analyze existing purchase order completion data
2. Calculate initial supplier ratings and metrics
3. Populate supplier performance history
4. Set up baseline supplier scores

## Business Logic Integration

### Supplier Suggestion Algorithm
```
Score = (Performance Score × 0.4) + (Relevance Score × 0.3) + (Availability Score × 0.2) + (Cost Score × 0.1)

Where:
- Performance Score: Based on historical ratings and reliability
- Relevance Score: Based on asset type, problem type, and specialties match
- Availability Score: Based on response time and business hours
- Cost Score: Based on average order amounts and competitiveness
```

### Supplier Performance Calculation
- **Quality Rating**: Average of all quality ratings from completed orders
- **Delivery Rating**: Based on on-time delivery percentage
- **Reliability Score**: Composite score including response time, issue resolution, and consistency
- **Cost Effectiveness**: Comparison of quoted vs actual costs

### Automated Workflows
1. **Purchase Order Completion** → Update supplier performance metrics
2. **Payment Processing** → Update supplier payment reliability
3. **Work Order Assignment** → Log supplier work history
4. **Maintenance Completion** → Update supplier expertise scores
5. **Supplier Rating Updates** → Trigger supplier status changes
