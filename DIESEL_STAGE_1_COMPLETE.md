# Diesel Management System - Stage 1 Complete âœ…

## Foundation & Infrastructure - DONE

### âœ… Database Tables Created

1. **diesel_transactions enhancements**
   - Added `previous_balance` column (traceability)
   - Added `current_balance` column (traceability)
   - Balance is calculated and stored with each transaction
   
2. **diesel_evidence table**
   - Stores photo evidence for transactions
   - Evidence types: consumption, entry, adjustment, meter_reading, cuenta_litros, delivery, invoice
   - Categories: machine_display, cuenta_litros, delivery_truck, invoice, before, after, tank_gauge
   - Metadata stores compression info, device details
   - Cascade delete with transactions

3. **diesel_inventory_snapshots table**
   - Daily/monthly inventory reconciliation
   - Tracks opening/closing balances
   - Records entries, consumptions, adjustments
   - Supports physical count with variance calculation
   - Validation workflow (validated_by, validated_at)

### âœ… Functions & Utilities

1. **get_warehouse_current_balance(warehouse_id)**
   - Returns current balance for any warehouse
   - Uses last transaction balance or calculates from scratch
   - Fast, stable function for API use

2. **generate_diesel_snapshot(warehouse_id, date)**
   - Generates daily snapshot for reconciliation
   - Calculates all movements for the day
   - Handles missing opening balance
   - Upsert pattern (update if exists)

### âœ… Performance Indices

- `idx_diesel_evidence_transaction` - Fast evidence lookup by transaction
- `idx_diesel_evidence_type` - Filter by evidence type
- `idx_diesel_evidence_created` - Chronological sorting
- `idx_diesel_snapshots_warehouse_date` - Fast snapshot queries
- `idx_diesel_transactions_balance` - Balance tracking queries

### âœ… Storage Bucket

**diesel-evidence** bucket created:
- Public read access
- 50MB file size limit
- Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, PDF
- Authenticated upload only
- Users can delete own uploads

### âœ… RLS Policies - ALIGNED WITH EXISTING PATTERNS

#### Pattern Alignment:
Following the same hierarchical access control as `assets`, `work_orders`, `completed_checklists`:

1. **Service role** - Full access (standard)
2. **Hierarchical access** - Three levels:
   - Global: GERENCIA_GENERAL (no plant/business unit restriction)
   - Business Unit: JEFE_UNIDAD_NEGOCIO (all plants in their BU)
   - Plant: Everyone else (only their assigned plant)

#### Tables Protected:

**diesel_transactions:**
- âœ… Hierarchical access policy (ALL operations)
- âœ… Service role full access
- âœ… Follows same pattern as `assets` table

**diesel_evidence:**
- âœ… Access via transactions (if you can see transaction, you can see evidence)
- âœ… Service role full access
- âœ… Follows "via" pattern like `checklist_evidence`

**diesel_inventory_snapshots:**
- âœ… Hierarchical access via warehouses and plants
- âœ… Service role full access
- âœ… Three-tier access matching organizational structure

**storage.objects (diesel-evidence):**
- âœ… Public can view (like other evidence buckets)
- âœ… Authenticated can upload
- âœ… Users can update/delete their own

### âœ… Database Migration Files

1. `migrations/sql/20251001_diesel_production_tables.sql` - Tables, functions, indices
2. `migrations/sql/20251001_diesel_rls_policies.sql` - Documentation of policies

### âœ… Permissions Granted

- authenticated users: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE on all diesel tables
- authenticated users: EXECUTE on helper functions
- public: View evidence in storage bucket
- authenticated: Upload evidence to storage bucket

## Key Features Implemented

### Traceability
Every transaction now records:
- Previous warehouse balance
- Current warehouse balance after transaction
- Full audit trail of inventory changes

### Evidence Requirements
- **Consumption**: 2 photos required (machine display + cuenta litros)
- **Entry**: 1+ photos required (delivery truck, invoice, tank gauge)
- **Adjustment**: Optional but recommended

### Balance Tracking
- Real-time balance calculation
- Historical balance snapshots for reconciliation
- Fast queries using indexed balance columns
- Function-based balance retrieval for API

### Security
- Row-level security matches existing system patterns
- Three-tier hierarchical access (global/business unit/plant)
- Evidence access tied to transaction access
- Time-limited edit/delete windows for data integrity

---

## Testing Verification

### Test Balance Calculation
```sql
SELECT warehouse_id, get_warehouse_current_balance(warehouse_id) as balance
FROM diesel_warehouses;
```

### Test Snapshot Generation
```sql
SELECT generate_diesel_snapshot('warehouse-uuid', CURRENT_DATE);
```

### Test RLS Policies
```sql
-- As regular user (should see only their plant)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM diesel_transactions;

-- As business unit manager (should see all plants in BU)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM diesel_transactions;

-- As GERENCIA_GENERAL (should see all)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM diesel_transactions;
```

### Test Evidence Upload
```sql
INSERT INTO diesel_evidence (transaction_id, evidence_type, photo_url, category)
VALUES ('transaction-uuid', 'consumption', 'https://...', 'machine_display');
```

## Next Steps: Stage 2

Now ready to build the mobile-first components:
1. Asset selector with business unit filtering
2. Reading capture component (hours/km validation)
3. Consumption entry form with cuenta litros validation
4. Diesel entry form with evidence requirements
5. Adjustment form with flexible evidence
