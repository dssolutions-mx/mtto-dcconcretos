## Suggestion Algorithm Architecture

### Multi-Factor Scoring System

```
Final Score = (Performance Score × 0.4) + (Relevance Score × 0.3) + (Availability Score × 0.2) + (Cost Score × 0.1)
```

#### 1. Performance Score (40% weight)
**Based on historical data:**
- Overall supplier rating (20%)
- Reliability score (15%)
- On-time delivery percentage (10%)
- Quality satisfaction scores (10%)
- Issue resolution rate (5%)

**Data Sources:**
- `supplier_performance_history` table
- `supplier_work_history` table
- Purchase order completion data

#### 2. Relevance Score (30% weight)
**Based on supplier specialization:**
- Asset type compatibility (15%)
- Problem description keyword matching (10%)
- Service category alignment (5%)
- Geographic proximity bonus (5%)
- Industry expertise match (5%)

**Data Sources:**
- `supplier_services` table
- `suppliers` table (specialties, industry)
- Asset information and maintenance history

#### 3. Availability Score (20% weight)
**Based on supplier capacity:**
- Response time history (10%)
- Current workload assessment (5%)
- Business hours compatibility (5%)
- Lead time analysis (5%)

**Data Sources:**
- Business hours from `suppliers` table
- Historical response times from performance data
- Active work order assignments

#### 4. Cost Score (10% weight)
**Based on pricing competitiveness:**
- Average order amount comparison (5%)
- Cost-effectiveness ratio (3%)
- Budget alignment (2%)

**Data Sources:**
- Historical pricing data
- Budget constraints from work order

## Suggestion Engine Components

### 1. Asset-Based Matching
```typescript
interface AssetBasedMatching {
  asset_id: string
  asset_type: string
  asset_category: string
  maintenance_history: MaintenanceHistory[]
  location: GeographicLocation
  critical_systems: string[]
}
```

**Matching Logic:**
- Find suppliers with experience on similar asset types
- Prioritize suppliers who have successfully worked on identical assets
- Consider geographic proximity for faster response

### 2. Problem Description Analysis
```typescript
interface ProblemAnalysis {
  keywords: string[]
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex'
  required_skills: string[]
  estimated_duration: number
}
```

**Analysis Process:**
1. Extract keywords from problem description
2. Match against supplier specialties
3. Assess urgency and complexity requirements
4. Identify required technical skills

### 3. Geographic Optimization
```typescript
interface GeographicOptimization {
  asset_location: {
    city: string
    state: string
    coordinates?: [number, number]
  }
  supplier_locations: SupplierLocation[]
  travel_time_importance: number
}
```

**Optimization Factors:**
- Distance-based scoring (primary)
- Same-city bonus (secondary)
- Regional expertise bonus (tertiary)

### 4. Performance History Analysis
```typescript
interface PerformanceAnalysis {
  supplier_id: string
  time_range: '30d' | '90d' | '1y' | 'all'
  metrics: {
    quality_rating: number
    delivery_rating: number
    reliability_score: number
    cost_accuracy: number
    issue_resolution_rate: number
  }
}
```

**Analysis Metrics:**
- Recent performance trends
- Consistency across different metrics
- Improvement over time
- Issue resolution patterns

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Suggestion Engine
```typescript
class SupplierSuggestionEngine {
  async generateSuggestions(request: SupplierSuggestionRequest): Promise<SupplierSuggestion[]> {
    // 1. Parse and analyze work order context
    const context = await this.analyzeWorkOrderContext(request)

    // 2. Filter eligible suppliers
    const eligibleSuppliers = await this.filterEligibleSuppliers(context)

    // 3. Score suppliers using multi-factor algorithm
    const scoredSuppliers = await this.scoreSuppliers(eligibleSuppliers, context)

    // 4. Rank and return top suggestions
    return this.rankSuggestions(scoredSuppliers)
  }
}
```

### Context Analysis Pipeline
1. **Asset Context Extraction** - Analyze asset type, history, and requirements
2. **Problem Context Analysis** - Parse problem description and extract requirements
3. **Geographic Context** - Determine location-based constraints
4. **Budget Context** - Analyze cost constraints and preferences
5. **Urgency Context** - Assess time sensitivity requirements

### Supplier Filtering Logic
```typescript
private async filterEligibleSuppliers(context: WorkOrderContext): Promise<Supplier[]> {
  const filters = [
    // Status filter - only active suppliers
    { status: 'active' },

    // Type filter - based on work order requirements
    ...this.getTypeFilters(context),

    // Geographic filter - location-based filtering
    ...this.getGeographicFilters(context),

    // Capacity filter - availability assessment
    ...this.getCapacityFilters(context),

    // Specialty filter - expertise matching
    ...this.getSpecialtyFilters(context)
  ]

  return await this.applyFilters(filters)
}
```
