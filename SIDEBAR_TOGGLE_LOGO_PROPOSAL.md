# Sidebar Toggle & Logo Placement Proposal
## Maintenance Management System - Navigation Improvements

### Current Issues Identified

1. **Toggle Button Placement**: Currently inside sidebar header with `ml-auto`, making it hard to find when sidebar is collapsed
2. **Logo Inconsistency**: Different logo presentation between expanded/collapsed and mobile/desktop
3. **Poor Accessibility**: Toggle button not easily discoverable or accessible
4. **Cramped Header**: Logo and toggle compete for space in sidebar header
5. **Mobile UX**: Different interaction patterns between mobile and desktop
